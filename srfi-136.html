<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
  SRFI 9 and the compatible R7RS-small provide Scheme with record
  types. The basic problem that is solved by these record types is that
  they allow the user to introduce new types, disjoint from all existing
  types. The record type system described in this document is a
  conservative extension to SRFI 9 and R7RS record types (in other words, the
  keyword <code>define-record-type</code> defined in this specification
  can serve as the equally named keyword from SRFI 9 and R7RS and can thus
  be safely exported from <code>(srfi 9)</code> and <code>(scheme base)</code>)
  that is intended to
  solve another fundamental problem, namely the introduction of subtypes.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>
  No issues at present.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
As mentioned in the abstract, the record type definitions of
R7RS-small allow for the introduction of new disjoint types,
called <em>record types</em>. Each value of such a record type denotes
a set of locations, one location for each record field defined by the
record type. Each field, that is the location corresponding to that
field, can be either mutable or immutable depending on whether the
record type definition defines a mutator procedure for that field or
not. To give immutable fields a value, a suitable constructor procedure of
the record type has to be defined and used.
</p>

<p>
  What isn't specified by the record types of R7RS-small is a way to
  extend record types.
  <em>Extending</em> a record type means to create a new record type
  that extends the given record type by adding zero or more new fields to it. The
  newly created type is not disjoint to all existing types in the sense
  that it effectively becomes a subtype of the record type that is
  extended. In order to construct a value of an extended type, the
  constructor of the type that is extended has to be invoked on the way.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this SRFI is to specify a syntactic extension to the
  record system of R7RS-small that allows extending record types in
  the manner described above. The constructor procedures that can be
  defined with the syntax of this SRFI are of a rather rigid form (for
  example, the first arguments of a constructor of a subtype have to
  correspond to the arguments of the constructor of the parent, if
  any). If constructors of a different signature are needed, it is
  expected that they are defined by the user using ordinary Scheme
  definitions and the constructor defined by the record type
  definition. Another syntactic layer on top of the record types
  defined here is also possible. The guiding principle of this
  proposal, however, is just to provide the primitives on which more
  sophisticated systems (like an object system with single
  inheritance) can be built.
</p>

<p>
  This SRFI differs from related specifications like SRFI 131 in that it
  does not rely on the identity of field names in order to specify a constructor
  for record-subtypes. In SRFI 136, parent fields in a constructor specification
  are solely referred to by position. On the other hand, there hasn't been reached a
  consensus by the community yet whether parent field names in SRFI 131 are matched as
  symbols or identifiers (or rather whether the former is compatible with the semantics of
  R7RS). In fact, the main reason for developing SRFI 136 was that it is mostly agnostic
  to whether field names are symbols or identifiers.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, SRFI 136 follows the R6RS's record system in that regard.
</p>

<p>
  Without any further extension by further SRFIs or further revisions of R7RS,
  the syntactic interface makes the following guarantees:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An immutable field of a parent record type remains immutable in its subtypes.</li>
  <li>A subtype cannot change the subset of those parent fields that are initialized in
    the constructor.</li>
  <li>Subtypes cannot overwrite parent fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This specification also provides a minimal procedural interface and
very basic introspection facilities, on which more sophisticated
systems like the one specified by SRFI 99 can be built. R7RS leaves it
open whether the record type descriptor is bound by a record-type
definition to a runtime object or a syntactic representation. In order
to be able to provide introspection facilities already at the
expansion level, in this specification the choice of a syntactic
representation as a keyword has been made. Due to this choice, the
record type descriptor cannot serve as a descriptor for the record
type in the procedural interface.  However, a <em>runtime record-type
descriptor</em> can be extracted from the keyword to be used in the
procedural interface.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>
This SRFI extends 7.1.6 of R7RS-small as follows:
</p>

<pre>
 &lt;definition&gt;           
   -&gt; &lt;record-type definition&gt;
 
 &lt;record type definition&gt;
   -&gt; (define-record-type &lt;type spec&gt;
        &lt;constructor spec&gt;
        &lt;predicate spec&gt;
        &lt;field spec&gt; ...)

 &lt;type spec&gt;  -&gt; &lt;type name&gt;
              -&gt; (&lt;type name&gt; &lt;parent&gt;)

 &lt;constructor spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;constructor name&gt;
              -&gt; (&lt;constructor name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)

 &lt;predicate spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;predicate name&gt;

 &lt;field spec&gt; -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt;)
              -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt; &lt;mutator name&gt;)

 &lt;parent&gt;           -&gt; &lt;keyword&gt;
                    -&gt; #f

 &lt;type name&gt;        -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;constructor name&gt; -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;predicate name&gt;   -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;accessor name&gt;    -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;mutator name&gt;     -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;field name&gt;       -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
                    -&gt; #f
</pre>

<p>
It also extends 7.1.3 of R7RS-small as follows:
</p>

<pre>
 &lt;macro use&gt;        -&gt; (&lt;type name&gt; (&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;datum&gt; ...))
                    -&gt; (&lt;type name&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
  The semantics of a record type definition is the same as in R7RS-small
  except for the following additions:
</p>

<p>
  The record-type definition macro-expands into a cluster of definitions that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>defines a keyword <code>&lt;type name&gt;</code> as the record-type
    descriptor for the new record-type;</li>
  <li>defines a constructor for instances of the new record-type
    (unless the constructor spec is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines a predicate that recognizes instances of the new
  record-type and its subtypes (unless the predicate spec
  is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines an accessor for each field name;</li>
  <li>defines a mutator for each mutable field name</li>
</ul>
<p>From the keyword that is bound to the record-type descriptor, a runtime representation for the
  use in procedural interface defined below can be extracted.</p>

<p>
A record type definition extends R7RS-small with the following additional options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> expression is specified and not <code>#f</code>,
    then it must be an identifier bound to a record-type descriptor that serves as the
    parent record-type for the record-type being defined.
  </li>
  <li>If <code>#f</code> is specified for the constructor or predicate,
    then no constructor or predicate procedure is defined. (This is
    useful when the record-type being defined will be used as an
    abstract base class and has no immutable fields.)</li>
  <li>If the constructor name is specified as an identifier, then the
    constructor's arguments correspond to the arguments of the
    parent's constructor (if there is no parent constructor, the
    arguments correspond to the argument of the constructor of the
    parent's parent, and so on) followed by the new fields added by
    this record-type definition in the specified order.</li>
  <li>If <code>#f</code> is specified for a field name that field is effectively
    unnamed.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a constructor spec is of the form <code>(&lt;constructor
    name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)</code> and the parent's constructor
    takes <em>n</em> arguments (if there is no parent constructor, the
    constructor of the parent's parent is considered, and so on)</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first <em>n</em> field names are arbitrary identifiers,
    which correspond to arguments of the parent's constructor. (While
    it is not strictly necessary to name these identifiers after the
    identifiers used in the parent's constructor, it will certainly
    help readability of the source.) The other arguments correspond to
    field names or accessor names (field names take precedence)
    declared in the same <code>define-record-type</code> form. (Here,
    an argument corresponds to an accessor name as if it was a
    variable reference corresponding to a variable.)</li>
  <li>It is an error if the same identifier appears more than once in
    the field names of the constructor spec.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let <code>&lt;type name&gt;</code> be the record-type descriptor
  for a record-type defined by:
<pre>
 (define-record-type (&lt;type name&gt; &lt;parent&gt;)
   &lt;constructor spec&gt;
   &lt;predicate spec&gt;
   &lt;field spec&gt; ...)
</pre>
Then the macro use <code>(&lt;type name&gt;
  (&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;datum&gt; ...))</code> macro-expands into:
<pre>
 (&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;datum&gt; ... &lt;parent&gt; &lt;field-spec&gt; ...)
</pre>
(If the record-type does not have a parent, <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>.)
</p>
Furthermore, the macro use <code>(&lt;type name&gt;)</code>
macro-expands into an expression that evaluates to an object that
serves as a runtime record-type descriptor for the procedural
interface (see below).

<p>
  <i>Rationale: This allows the introspection of the record type at
  macro-expansion type.  The arguments <code>&lt;keyword&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;datum&gt;</code> are to support CPS-techniques in
  macro programming.  For example, a pattern matcher written
  using <code>syntax-rules</code> can support matching of record
  instances and can get hold of the record-type structure at
  macro-expansion time by using the macro <code>(&lt;type name&gt;
  (&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;datum&gt; ...))</code></i>
</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

The following set of procedures is defined:

<p>
  <code>(record? <em>obj</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns <code>#t</code> if and only if <code><em>obj</em></code> is a record constructed by
  one of the constructors defined by this specification.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-descriptor? <em>obj</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns <code>#t</code> if and only if <code><em>obj</em></code> is
  a runtime record-type descriptor.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-descriptor <em>record</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns the runtime record-type descriptor of the record type of the
  record <code></em>record</em></code>.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-predicate <em>rtd</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns a type predicate of the record type, for
  which <code><em>rtd</em></code> is the runtime record-type
  descriptor.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-name <em>rtd</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns the name of the record-type, for
  which <code><em>rtd</em></code> is the runtime record-type
  descriptor, as a symbol.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-parent <em>rtd</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns the runtime record-type descriptor of the parent of the
  record-type, for which
  <code><em>rtd</em></code> is the runtime record-type descriptor,
  or <code>#f</code> if there is no parent.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(record-type-fields <em>rtd</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>
  Returns a list of three-element lists of the
  form <code>(<em>field-name</em> <em>accessor</em> <em>mutator</em>)</code>
  corresponding to the fields (excluding those of parent record-types)
  defined by the record-type, for
  which <code><em>rtd</em></code> is the runtime record-type descriptor, such
  that:
  <ul>
    <li><code><em>field name</em></code> is the name of the field as a symbol or
      <code>#f</code> if it is unnamed;</li>
    <li><code><em>accessor</em></code> is an accessor defined for the field;</li>
    <li><code><em>mutator</em></code> is a mutator defined for the field if it is mutable and
      <code>#f</code> otherwise.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <code>(make-record-type-descriptor <em>name</em> <em>fieldspecs</em>)</code>
<p>

<p>
  <code>(make-record-type-descriptor <em>name</em> <em>fieldspecs</em> <em>parent</em>)</code>
<p>
  
<p>
  If <code><em>name</em></code> evaluates to a symbol <code>&lt;type
  name&gt;</code> and <code><em>parent</em></code> evaluates to the
  runtime record-type descriptor of a record type definition of
  <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> (if the argument <code><em>parent</em></code> is omitted,
  <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> defaults to <code>#f</code>),
  and <code><em>fieldspecs</em></code> evaluates to a list of field
  specifiers, where each field specifier is either a
  <ul>
    <li>a symbol naming the (mutable) field,</li>
    <li>a list of the form <code>(mutable <em>name</em>)</code>, or</li>
    <li>a list of the form <code>(immutable <em>name</em>)</code>,</li>      
  </ul>
  the application
  <code>(make-record-type-descriptor <em>name</em> <em>fieldspecs</em> <em>parent</em>)</code>
  evaluates to
<pre>
 (let ()
   (define-record-type (&lt;type name&gt; &lt;parent&gt;)
     #f
     #f
     &lt;field spec&gt; ...)
   (&lt;type name&gt;))
</pre>
where each <code>&lt;field spec&gt;</code> corresponds to a
field specifier in <code><em>fieldspecs</em></code> as follows:
<ul>
  <li>If the
    field specifier is a symbol <code><em>name</em></code> or a list of
    the form <code>(mutable <em>name</em>)</code>, the
    corresponding <code>&lt;field spec&gt;</code>
    is <code>(<em>name</em> <em>accessor</em> <em>mutator</em>)</code>,
    where <em>accessor</em> and <em>mutator</em> are fresh symbols
  </li>
  <li>
    If the field specifier is of the form
    <code>(immutable <em>name</em>)</code>, the
    corresponding <code>&lt;field spec&gt;</code>
    is <code>(<em>name</em> <em>accessor</em>)</code>,
    where <em>accessor</em> is a fresh symbol.
  </li>
</ul>
Note that the newly bound runtime record type
descriptor differs from any existing runtime record-type descriptor.
</p>

<p>
  <code>(make-record <em>rtd</em> <em>field-vector</em>)</code>
<p>

<p>
  Returns an instance of the record type, for
  which <code><em>rtd</em></code> is the runtime record-type
  descriptor, whose fields (including those of parent record-types
  with the fields of parent record-types coming first) are initialized
  with the objects in the vector
  <em>field-vector</em> in order. It is an error if the <em>field-vector</em> does not have as
  many elements as there are fields. It is unspecified whether the vector is shared with
  the newly created record.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
The sample implementation is given as an R7RS library, which only relies on the bindings
exported by <code>(scheme base)</code>. In particular, it is implemented using only
syntax-rules macros and does not rely on more sophisticated/less beautiful macro facilities.
</p>

<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-136/srfi-136.tgz">Source for the sample implementation.</a>

<p>
The sample implementation is accompanied with an implementation of SRFI 131 on top of the syntax
and procedures defined in this SRFI. Using this implementation, SRFI 131 and
SRFI 136 record-types can mutually inherit each other and can thus be mixed in a program.
(Caveat: SRFI 131 matches field names
as symbols while the provided sample implementation of SRFI 136 matches field names on the
syntactic level as identifiers. Thus, SRFI 131 record-types can only reference fields of
SRFI 136 parents in their constructors if they are not being renamed during macro expansion.)
</p>

<p>
As the shape of constructors between SRFI 131 and SRFI 136 is incompatible, a SRFI 136 record-type
with a SRFI 131 parent behaves as if the parent's constructor spec was given by a single identifier
(that is without any field names as arguments).
</p>

<p>
  For demonstration purposes of SRFI 137, the provided sample
  implementation for SRFI 136 builds upon that SRFI 137.
